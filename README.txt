This project is my compilation of different HTML, Javascript, CSS and Bootstrap small utilities 
and front-end examples for using in webpages.  It is meant to help give working examples to
help piece together front-end designs and functionalities.  

Bootstrap_Versions: This folder contains valid, recent versions of Bootstrap.  Specifically, Bootstrap 3 and 4 are included.
		    If you are interested in learning Bootstrap, it's worth taking time exploring these folders.  
		    Side Note: Bootstrap 4 is not supported by Internet Explorer 9 or lower.
